    <p>The software section of this project is organized in a recommended order,
      but can be easily navigated through with the use of the side navigation bar.
      For each lesson there are multiple resources for the user: there is a YouTube
      video presentation, as well as a downloadable pdf word file with included pictures
    of step-by-step directions. </p>
  </div>

<hr class="boldline">

<div class="mainware">

  <h2 id="materials" style="text-align:left;">Materials</h2>
To get started, here is a list of materials you will need for software instillation:

<br>-Raspberry Pi 3B
<br>-Micro SD Card (32GB)
<br>- RTL-SDR
<br>- A computer monitor
<br>-Ethernet cable (if not using WiFi option)
<br>-Radio antenna
<br>-Personal computer
<br>-Keyboard


<hr class="thinline">
Before starting this tutorial, it’s highly recommended to go through the <a href="#Vocabulary">Software Vocabulary</a> section to get familiar with the concepts explained in the following tutorial.
<hr class="thinline">

<div>
  <h2 id="intro" style="text-align:left;">Introduction</h2>
Most of us familiar with using a Mac or PC computer and are comfortable with this kind of set up. This project’s set up is going to be different than these systems, but not difficult to navigate after spending some time getting familiar with all of the components. For this project, we will be using a Raspberry Pi as our computing device. This type of computing device doesn’t store data locally, so we will need to use an SD card for storage. Since we will be starting with a computing device that doesn’t have a preinstalled OS or GUI, we will need to set these up so that we can interact with the computer with ease. We chose Ubuntu (a version of Linux) as our OS along with the MATE GUI extension.
</div>
<hr class="boldline">

  <h2 id="setup" style="text-align:left;">Material Set Up</h2>
  To get started, we need to make sure that all our wires are hooked up and ready to go.
  <br>-Hook up your Raspberry Pi to your monitor.
<br>-Plug in your ethernet cable (or wifi).
  <br>-Plug in your Raspberry Pi into a power source.
  <br>-Hook up to your keyboard (we used a wireless hook up for ours).</br>

<br><span class="boldfont"> Raspberry Pi Hooked Up</span></br>
<hr class="boldline">

  <h2 id="download" style="text-align:left;">Download Ubuntu MATE</h2>
  For the following steps of installing Ubuntu MATE I followed the tutorial below presented by Tech Radar.
<br><a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-the-raspberry-pi">Install Ubuntu MATE on Raspberry Pi</a></br>
First, we will need to install Ubuntu Mate as our operating system and GUI. We will need our personal computer in order to do the first step in this process.
To download Ubuntu MATE we will use our personal computer and visit<a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/"> Ubuntu MATE Download</a> and click on “Raspberry Pi (Recommended)”. At the time of writing this, I chose “10.04.2 Bionic” as the release version that I am running.

<hr class="thinline">

<h4 style="text-align:left;"> Decompressing the File</h4>
After downloading Ubuntu MATE, we will need to install a decompression utility in order to read the Ubuntu file.</br>
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">For Mac:</span> The Unarchiver is available free from the App Store to extract the .xz file. Once the utility is installed, double-click the file in your downloads to extract the image (.img) file.</br>
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">For Windows:</span> Go to the 7-Zip website to install the application. Click on ‘Download’, choose ‘Save’. Go to ‘Downloads’ in File Explorer. Double click on the ‘7-Zip’ file. Choose ‘Install’.
I’m using a Mac, and my steps/downloads looked like this:
  <img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/unarchiver.png" class="left" alt="Download Unarchiver Image" style="width:500px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;">
  <br><span class="boldfont">Here I have ‘The Unarchiver’ decompression utility downloading that I downloaded from the app store.</span></br>
<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/desktop.png" class="left" alt="Organizing files" style="width:250px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;">
<br><span class="boldfont">I saved both of these downloads next to each other on my desktop for easy navigation.</span></br>
<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/ubuntu_file.png" class="left" alt="Redownloaded Ubuntu" style="width:250px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;">
<br><span class="boldfont">After opening my Ubuntu file by double clicking, my file converted and saved on my desktop like this.</span></br>

<hr class"thinline">
<h4 style="text-align:left;">Formatting the Micro SD card</h4>
For the micro SD card to be compatible with the  Raspberry Pi, it has to be formatted to FAT32.
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">For Mac:</span> In order for your microSD card to be compatible with the Raspberry Pi it must be formatted to FAT32.
Connect the microSD card to your mac. The system will automatically mount it. Click ‘Spotlight’ at the top right of the screen, type ‘Disk Utility’ and press return.
Once Disk Utility launches, select the microSD card from the list of available disks in the pane on the left. Click the ‘Erase’ tab, then select ‘MS-DOS (FAT)’ from the ‘Format’ drop down menu.
You can also set a name for the microSD card here e.g. MY SD 1. Click the ‘Erase’ button when you’re ready.
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">For Windows:</span> Insert your SD card into the slot on your computer or a USB adapter.
Windows will now inform you that you need to format the disk in order to continue. Click ‘Format Disk’. Next, you can choose the format, file system, allocation unit size and volume label. Windows will warn you that formatting will erase all previous data on the SD card. Choose ‘Ok’ to continue. The device will then be formatted.
If you don’t see the above notification, open Windows Explorer. Search for the SD drive. Right-click on this and from the drop-down menu, select format. Windows will automatically default to FAT32.
<hr class="thinline">

<h4 style="text-align:left;">Download and install etcher</h4>
This allows us to write our file onto our micro SD card. You can download Etcher here <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Download Etcher</a>.
Once you open Etcher it will prompt you to select an image. Select Ubuntu MATE, and then click ‘Flash’. This process might take up to 20 mins.
<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/etcher.png" class="left" alt="Download Etcher" style="width:500px; height:300px;border-radius:5px;">
<br><span class="boldfont">Etcher Download Screen</span></br>
If you would like to do this step through command line in your terminal, you can visit step 7 in the linked tutorial at the beginning of this tutorial.

<hr class="boldline">

  <h2 id="raspberry" style="text-align:left;">Set Up Ubuntu MATE on Raspberry Pi</h2>
  After the writing process is done, safely eject your micro SD card and place it into your Raspberry Pi.
  <img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/sdcard.jpeg" class="left" alt="SD Card Placement" style="width:300px; height:350px;border-radius:5px;">
<br><span class="boldfont">Where to place the SD card in Raspberry Pi.</span></br>
Make sure all connections we set up in the beginning of the tutorial are still in place so that our system will start up on the monitor screen.
The system will now prompt you to choose your location settings, and to set up your computer system names. Once this set up process is complete, the Ubuntu MATE desktop will open.
The OS will display a welcome message and offer you a tour of Ubuntu’s features. Make sure to go through this if you haven’t used the MATE desktop environment before.
<hr class="thinline">
<h4 style="text-align:left;">Updates</h4>
The version of Ubuntu MATE you have now installed may not be fully up-to-date.
To check if this is the case, go to System > Software Updater.
The system will now scan for updates. <br>A box will appear stating‘Updated software has been issued since Ubuntu x.04 was released. Do you wish to update?’. <span class="commandline">Click ‘Install Now’ </span>to update your system.
<hr class="thinline">
<h4 style="text-align:left;">Troubleshooting</h4>
Some Ubuntu MATE users have reported issues with connecting to Wi-Fi after install, the network manager says the ‘device not ready’. This issue is specific to the Raspberry Pi 3. fortunately restarting the Raspberry Pi almost always fixes this problem.
Other users have reported issues installing and upgrading software using the built-in software updater. If this happens, open the MATE Terminal. Next, run the command:
<span class="commandline">sudo apt-get update</span>
then:
<span class="commandline">sudo apt-get upgrade</span>
That should fix the issue and you'll now have Ubuntu MATE running on your Raspberry Pi!
You have now successfully installed Ubuntu MATE onto your Raspberry Pi!

<hr class="boldline">

  <h2 id="command" style="text-align:left;">Introduction to Command Line</h2>
  <h4 style="text-align:left;">What is command line?</h4>
<p><span class="boldfont">Command line or “Command Line User Interface”</span>: is a way of communicating with
your computer through typed commands; this is usually done through the computer’s terminal.</p>

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command2.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:600px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<p><span class="boldfont"> This is what my computer terminal looks like when I open it.</p></span>

  <p>Our computers are usually run through a GUI (graphical user interface), and
    so we are used to a different way of navigating through our systems.

<p>  <span class="underline">For example:</span> If you are on your desktop and
  want to go into your documents folder (which is on your desktop), you will double
  click on that folder and it will open up to display the contents in your documents folder.
This function is run through a GUI.</p>

<p>  In command line, we don’t have a GUI that makes it so that we can double click
  into a location, instead we will need to type in our commands into our terminal.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:left;">Exercise:</h4>
  <p>For this exercise we are going to be using our Raspberry Pi as our computing device,
    not our personal computer. This example is specific to the Linux operating system.</p>
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command1.jpeg" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:400px; height:500px;border-radius:5px;"></br>
<span class="boldfont">  How to access the terminal through our new desktop</span>

  <p>You can also access your terminal through the command Ctrl + Alt + T </p>

<span class="italic">  <p> Tip: You can create new documents/folders by right clicking. </p></span>

  <p>Create a folder on your desktop that is called “Example”</p>

  <p>Inside of the “Example” folder, create another folder called “example_2”</p>

  <p>Inside of the “example_2” folder create an empty file document called “example_3”</p>

  <p>Now that we have our set up ready, lets navigate using our terminal.</p>

  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: ls *enter*</p></span>

  <span class="boldfont">ls</span> stands for ‘list directory’ This will show you what contents are in the location you are currently in on your computer.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command3.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:800px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

  <p><span class="boldfont">I typed ls and my terminal replied by listing all the contents in my current location on my computer</span></p>

<p>I know that I saved the files I want to locate in my desktop, so I will navigate there.</p>

  I can navigate to a  different location on my computer by typing <span class="commandline">cd [desired location] *enter*</span>

  <br><span class="commandline">cd</span> stands for ‘change directory’ and it allows the user to navigate to a different location on the computer.</br>

  <p>I changed my directory by typing <span class="commandline">cd desktop</span>, then I typed <span class="commandline">ls</span> to make sure I was in the right location.</p>

 <br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command4.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:800px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

  <p><span class="boldfont">Here are all of the folders/ files that are listed on my desktop.</span></p>


  I can see the ‘Example’ folder on my desktop so let’s change our directory again into this folder.
<span class="commandline"><p>  Type: cd Example *enter*</p></span>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: ls *enter*</p></span>

   <br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command5.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width: 800px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

  <p><span class="boldfont">We can see that our other folder “example_2” is inside of this folder just like we placed it before.</span></p>

  <p>Let’s go inside of this folder</p>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: cd Example_2 *enter* </p></span>

 <br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command6.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:800px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

  <p><span class="boldfont">The terminal replied saying that it can’t find the file that we are asking for.</span></p>
    <p> Why did this happen?</p>
  <p>Linux uses case sensitive code so that means that we need to be very careful about lower-case and upper-case letter. From now on, it’s a good rule of thumb to use all lower case letters so we don’t run into mistakes like this.</p>

  <p>Another note about Linux is that putting spaces when naming a file/document can cause you trouble later on. Instead of using a space, use “_” an underscore like I did in these files.</p>

  <p>Let’s try this again</p>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: cd example_2 *enter*</p></span>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: ls *enter*</p></span>

  <p>We can see our blank document “example_3”</p>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: cd example_3 *enter*</p></span>

 <br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command7.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:800px; height:350px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

  <p> <span class="boldfont">It will not let us open this document, because it isn’t a directory.</span></p>

<p>So this was a lot of steps to take to get into the folder that we wanted to be in. Usually, we will use a simplier method to navigate through our system.</p>

<span class="commandline"><p> Type: cd ~ *enter* </p></span>
<p>This command takes us back to our home navigation screen.</p>

  <p>Now that we are more familiar with the path that we will be taking, let’s get there with one line of code.</p>
  <span class="commandline"><p>Type: cd Desktop/Example/example_2 *enter*</p>
  <p>Type: ls *enter*</p></span>

   <br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/command8.png" class="left" alt="Command Line Code" style="width:800px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<p> <span class="boldfont"> We are in the same location we were before.</span></p>

<p>  We will continue to use a command line interface throughout various parts of this project.</p>

    <h2 id="gnu" style="text-align:left;">Download GNU Radio</h2>
    GNU Radio is the free open source software that we will be using to help us process our data.</br> To learn more about GNU Radio visit this site <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/about/">About GNU Radio</a>.</br>
    Make sure that you have an internet connection for these next steps. We used an ethernet hook up to ensure that we had an internet connection, but you can also hook up to wifi if available.
    <br>Plug in the RTL-SDR device into the Raspberry Pi.
    To install gnuradio on Ubuntu, open up your terminal (found under the menu tab on the top left -> system tools -> MATE Terminal)  and type in the following command:
  <br><span class="commandline">sudo apt install gnuradio-dev gr-osmosdr librtlsdr-dev build-essential git cmake ipython</span></br>
    <span class="commandline">Press enter.</span></br>
  You will be prompted for your password, provide password and press enter.
    It will ask you to continue after using a certain amount of disk space.
  <br><span class="commandline">type Y and press enter.</span></br>
    This download might take up to 20 mins.

    <hr class="boldline">

      <h2 id="firstdata" style="text-align:left;">Take your first radio data</h2>

    Open up your newly installed GNU Radio by typing in this command in the terminal:
         <br><span class="commandline">Gnuradio-companion</span></br>
      Please visit this link to learn some background info on the blocks we are going to use in GNU Radio:
      [link]
      1.  After gnuradio opens, make a simple flow chart by locating the RTL-SDR Source block and QT GUI Sink block and connecting them together. You can connect them by clicking on one black and then clicking on the other block right after.
      <br><span class="boldfont">Finding RTL-SDR Block</span></br>

Congratulations, you have collected your first radio data set!

      <hr class="boldline">

        <h2 id="spectrum" style="text-align:left;">Create a Spectrum Flowchart and Save the Data</h2>

        Now that you've familiarized yourself with gnuradio, it's time to create a more complex flowchart.
        The goal of this flowchart is to create a spectrum estimator, which will help us observe what frequencies
        that our radios can record. The final part of this lesson goes over how to save and locate your recorded data.

        <hr class="thinline">

    1. Start off with creating a new flowchart.
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow1.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:400px; height:400px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

      <br>2. Open the Options block by double clicking it. <p>Select 'No GUI' for 'Generate Options' and select 'Run to Completion' for the 'Run Options'.
<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow2.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:500px; height:400px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

    <br>  3.  In the premade variable block, double click to open it. <p>Rename the ID 'samp_rate' and set the value to 2e6 (2 million).</p>
      Press ‘apply’ and ‘OK’ to close the box.
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow3.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:500px; height:300px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>4. Add the 'RTL-Source' block. You can do this by locating it through the search bar and either double clicking on it, or by dragging it to the other side of the screen. Double click on the ‘RTL-Source’ block and change the 'RF Gain' to '45' (you might have to scroll down to see this option). Also, set the 'Sample Rate' to 'samp_rate'. Click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’.

<br>5. Create a variable block and name it 'veclength'. Make the value '1024'. click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’.

<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow5.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:800px; height:350px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>6. Add a 'Head' block. This block will limit the amount of data that will be processed. Set 'Num Items' to '10240000'. Click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. Connect the head block to the 'RTL-Source' block by clicking on the little blue box that reads ‘out’ on the “RTL-SDR Source” box and ‘in’ on the “Head” box. Click on the white screen and arrow should appear connecting the two.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow6_1.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:600px; height:400px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>7. Add a 'Stream to Vector' block and set the 'Num Items' to 'veclength'. Click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. Connect to 'Head' block.</p>
<br>8. Add an 'FFT' block. This will convert the data into a Fast Fourier Transform. Set the 'FFT size' to 'veclength'; click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. Connect to the 'Stream to Vector' block.</p>

<br>9. Add a 'Complex to Mag^2' block and set ‘Vec Length’ to ‘veclength’. Click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. This block makes all the data values real by squaring the complex numbers. Connect to 'FFT' block.</p>

<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow7-9.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:1000px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>10. Add an 'Integrate' block and set ‘Vec. Length' to 'veclength' and 'Decimation' to '100'. Change ‘IO Type’ to ‘Float’. You know the drill, click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. This reduces the data size by averaging every 100 items into one item. Connect to 'Mag^2' block.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow10.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:500px; height:400px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>11. Finally, add a 'File Sink' block and set 'Vec Length' to 'veclength'. Then change ‘IO Type’ to ‘Float’. Specify where you want the file to be written in by clicking on the ‘three dots’ icon next to ‘file’. Click ‘apply’ and ‘OK’. This will write the data into a file on your computer.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow11_0.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:600px; height:250px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

Here is how the final flowchart should look:

<br>12. Generate your flow chart.

<br>13. Press the green play button to ‘Execute the flow graph’.

<img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/flow12.png" class="left" alt="First Data Set" style="width:1000px; height:500px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br>14. To double check if your data was written in the desired location, open up your terminal. You can use the following Linux commands to find the recorded data:
ls: directory listing; this will show you all of the contents/ folders in your current location          on the computer.

cd *space* [insert location]: change directory to [your desired location]; this relocates you 	to whatever location you type after cd *space* [insert location].

For example: I started by typing ls into my terminal and pressed enter. This will show me the contents of the place I’m located on my computer. If I don’t remember exactly where I put the saved data, but I know the way to find it, I then find a file that would help me navigate closer to my desired data using cd [the place I want to go]. For example here is the code I used to find my “Waterfall Tutorial” file that I used to download my data to:


*At the bottom you will see that once I located my file, I typed <span class="commandline">ls -lh</span> to see how big my file was. The fact that it is 400k (400 kilobytes) tells me that I have located my file. To see why this is, proceed to the necxt tutorial "Is Our Data Size Correct?"

        <hr class="boldline">


          <h2 id="datasize" style="text-align:left;">Is our Data Size Correct?</h2>
          Congratulations, you have created your first complete flowchart! Now, how do you know that the amount of data you collected was correct and that this experiment went according to plan? Let’s go through what each block does and how much data it takes in so that we can check that we did everything correctly.

          Before we start I want to make clarifications between some vocabulary I will be using in this section.
<hr class="thinline">
<p><span class="boldtext">Sample:</span> This is how much data is collected per second. In this tutorial we chose 2,000,000     or   2106. In each of our ‘samples’ we collect 2 numbers.
<p><span class="boldtext">Bit:</span> Short for “binary digit”. This is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value of 1 or 0.
<p><span class="boldtext">Byte:</span> Equal to 8 bits.
<p><span class="boldtext">Kilobyte (kB):</span> Equal to 1024 bytes. (Try not to get this confused with the normal 1000=kilo).
<p><span class="boldtext">Vector:</span> In this context a vector is how we will be organizing our data so that we can process it in a following step.
<p><span class="boldtext">Integers:</span> In binary, integers (whole numbers that aren’t a decimal or fraction) take up 32 bits worth of data.
<p><span class="boldtext">Complex 32:</span> *Need help on this*
<p><span class="boldtext">Float 32:</span> *Need help on this*
<hr class="thinline">

<span class="boldtext">RTL-SDR Source: </span>
This controls how much data we initially take in from the telescope itself. We set a parameter of 2 million samples per second. For each sample that we take, we get 2 numbers. For each number we use 32 bits of data. If we do a quick calculation we see that we are taking in 1.28108 bits per second.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size1.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:600px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<span class="boldtext">Head:</span>
This block limits the total number of samples that will be collected, in this case 10,240,000 or 1.024107. From this, we can calculate how much time our total data collection should take.

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size2.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:400px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

If your data collection took around this time, it’s another indicator that our data collection probably went smoothly.

<br><span class="boldtext">Stream to Vector: </span>
We usually call whatever is input and output of a block an “item”. This block takes 1024 samples (input as individual items), and outputs them as one item vector of 1024 samples. We do this because in order to complete the next task (fast Fourier transform) we need a certain amount of samples at a time to complete this calculation.
Here is what our item number looks like before and after our “stream to vector”:

<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size3.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:500px; height:70px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<br><span class="boldtext">FFT (Fast Fourier Transform):</span>
	This block takes our data and finally puts it into a form (sin and cos waves) that is useful for us to use. Each vector is considered a time with a certain frequency. This allows us to have a graph with axis of time and frequency.
  <span class="boldtext">Complex to Mag^2:</span>
  So far we have had two numbers per sample: a real and imaginary (complex) number. This block takes our real and complex numbers, squares each of them, and adds the values. This changes our input of a complex 32 to a float 32.

  <p>This implements the following function:
  (real number in)^2 + (complex number in)^2 = new single number real output
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size4.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:600px; height:100px;border-radius:5px;"></br>
Integrate:
This block reduces the data size by averaging every 100 values into one value. We can take out current bit value and divide by 100.
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size5.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:320px; height:200px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

According to our previous calculations, the program is supposed to run for 5.12 seconds, so we will multiply our bits per second by 5.12 seconds.
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size6.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:400px; height:150px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

We will now do a few conversions so that we can put this value into kilobits.
<p><span class="boldtext">Converting bits to bytes: </span>
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size7.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:500px; height:150px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<p><span class="boldtext">Converting bytes to kilobytes: </span>
<br><img src="https://adampbeardsley.github.io/CHART/website/tutorials/size8.png" class="left" alt="Data Size" style="width:500px; height:150px;border-radius:5px;"></br>

<span class="boldtext">Congratulations, you completed this tutorial and proved that the amount of data you received is correct.</span>

An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply – the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (often referred to as the “OS”), the software wouldn’t function. The biggest differentiator between Linux and other OS is that Linux set out to be open sourced, which means that users can access it for free.
